## üìä Dataset

This project utilizes the **Heart Disease Dataset**, which contains 918 records and 12 attributes related to heart health. The model was trained on the following features:

- **Age**: Age of the patient [years]
- **Sex**: Sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
- **ChestPainType**: Chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
- **RestingBP**: Resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
- **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
- **FastingBS**: Fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
- **RestingECG**: Resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality, LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy]
- **MaxHR**: Maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
- **ExerciseAngina**: Exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
- **Oldpeak**: Oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
- **ST_Slope**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
- **HeartDisease**: The target variable indicating the presence of heart disease [1: Heart Disease, 0: Normal]

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Model

The prediction model was developed through a standard data science pipeline involving data cleaning, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Rows with missing or zero values for critical attributes like `Cholesterol` and `RestingBP` were imputed with the mean of the respective columns.
- **Encoding Categorical Data**: Categorical features (e.g., `Sex`, `ChestPainType`) were converted into a numerical format using one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: All numerical features were scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure that no single feature disproportionately influences the model's predictions.

### 2. Model Selection & Training

Several classification models were trained and evaluated on the preprocessed data:
- Logistic Regression
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model was selected as the final model due to its superior performance.

### 3. Evaluation

The chosen KNN model achieved the following results on the unseen test data:
- **Accuracy**: **88.59%**
- **F1 Score**: **89.86%**

The trained model and the scaler object have been saved to `model.pkl` for use in the Streamlit application.
